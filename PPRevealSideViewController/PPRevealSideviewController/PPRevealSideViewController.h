/** Allow pushing controllers on side views.
 
 This controller allows you to push views on sides. It is just as easy as a UINavigationController to use. It works on _both iPhone and iPad_, is fully compatible with non ARC and ARC projects.
 
 # Initializing
 
    MainViewController *main = [[MainViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"MainViewController" bundle:nil];
    UINavigationController *nav = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:main];
 
    _revealSideViewController = [[PPRevealSideViewController alloc] initWithRootViewController:nav];
 
    self.window.rootViewController = _revealSideViewController;
 
 # Pushing a controller
 You have several options to push a controller. The easiest way is : 
 
    PopedViewController *c = [[PopedViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"PopedViewController" bundle:nil ];
    [self.revealSideViewController pushViewController:c onDirection:PPRevealSideDirectionBottom animated:YES];
 
 This will push the controller on bottom, with a default offset.
 You have four directions : 
 
    PPRevealSideDirectionBottom
    PPRevealSideDirectionTop
    PPRevealSideDirectionLeft
    PPRevealSideDirectionRight
 
 # Popping
 To go back to your center controller from a side controller, you can pop :
 
    [self.revealSideViewController popViewControllerAnimated:YES];
 
If you want to pop a new center controller, then do the following :
 
    MainViewController *c = [[MainViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"MainViewController" bundle:nil];
    UINavigationController *n = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:c];
    [self.revealSideViewController popViewControllerWithNewCenterController:n animated:YES];
 
 # Pushing from a side
 If you are for example on the up side, and you want to push a controller on the left, you could call a method on your center controller asking him to display a left controller. But I thought it would be more convenient to provide a way to push an old controller directly. So, using the following will do the trick 
 
    [self.revealSideViewController pushOldViewControllerOnDirection:PPRevealSideDirectionLeft animated:YES];
 
 If you are on top, and you want to push a new controller on top (why not), the default behavior of the controller would be to close the top side since it's open. But you can force it to pop push :
 
    [self.revealSideViewController pushViewController:c onDirection:PPRevealSideDirectionTop animated:YES forceToPopPush:YES];
 
 # Note if you don't have controllers for all the sides
 If you want to present only a controller on the left and the right for example, you probably don't want the bouncing animation which shows that there is not yet a controller to present. This animation comes when you do a panning gesture with no preloaded controller, or no controller pushed yet on the triggered side.
 In that case, do the following 
 
    [self.revealSideViewController setDirectionsToShowBounce:PPRevealSideDirectionLeft | PPRevealSideDirectionRight];
 
 You could also don't want these animations at all. Disabled these like it 
    [self.revealSideViewController setDirectionsToShowBounce:PPRevealSideDirectionNone];
